# Local File Inclusion

## Purpose 

This script is for automating the usage of LFI in parallel with directory traversal.
It will return only the successful results if any, all other results will be ignored. 
In this future I may add filtering options, but this is meant to be a simple script 
to just run against a target and get the desired information quick. 

## Usage

*This tool is for use in only authorized situations, not nefarious situations.*

Come back for information to use as it's not even developed yet.
